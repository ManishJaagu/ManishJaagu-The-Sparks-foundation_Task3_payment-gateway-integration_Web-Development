A project by J.Manish

This is the task 3 of WEB AND APP DEVELOPMENT in the GRIP conducted bt The Sparks Foundation.
Task: Payment gateway Integrated website.

I chose this idea because, there are thousands of animals dying because of lack of food. Help them. As we are superior than these tiny animals. We must respect the Eco-system and save those tiny beautiful lives. 
Save nature - save lives!
